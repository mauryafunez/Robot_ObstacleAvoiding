# Robot_ObstacleAvoiding
Repository for my autonomous robot

The goal of this project was to be able to design a robot capable of driving through an obstacle course.

The ahdlParts folder contains all the basic digital logic components such as comparators that I used.
The vhdlFiles folder contains the main controllers for the robot. The controllers tell the robot what to do depending on what part of the obstacle course it is located at. 
The third file is the archived Quartus II project where all the files required to make the project run are located at.
